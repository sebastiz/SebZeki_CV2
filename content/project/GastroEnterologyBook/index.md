title: "Gastroenterology book"
summary: "A visual training manual for Gastroenterologists with automated MCQ's. Gastroenterology training covers a huge number of subjects. The gastroenterology training book was the first online attempt to provide a comprehensive training book where each subject is treated as a single, visually represented page. Each page can automatically generate MCQ's from the page so that there are an unlimited number of MCQs on the site. If you log in (which is free) you can get your performance on the MCQ's as well as your reading metrics so you can discover your knowledge gaps."
